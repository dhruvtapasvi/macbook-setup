# macbook-setup

This repository contains configuration settings and setup scripts for personalising my macbook.

## Instructions

Start off by running `source setup_terminal.sh` from Terminal `bash`. This creates the correct terminal environment.
Now run `source setup_config.sh`. This symlinks all the config files (e.g. vimrc, zshrc) into your home directory.
